# Algorithms (J-1)

This repository contains a large set of algorithms which I have written in Java. I've created this repository to learn about algorithms and improve solving different common computer science problems. I update this frequently, and write the programs in Java.

All of the following programs can be found in the src folder of Algorithms.


### Sorting:

* BubbleSort.java
* MergeSort.java
* QuickSort.java
* SortInsertion.java
* Hanoi.java (Towers of Hanoi Game)


### Searching:

* QuickFindUF.java (Quick Union Find)


### Recursion:

* Factorial.java
* fib.java (Fibonacci numbers)
* sum.java (Recursive sum)
